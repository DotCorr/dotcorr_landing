- **React-like DX**: Familiar hooks and component patterns
- **Performance Focus**: Direct native view access
- **Flutter Engine**: Used only for Dart runtime (like Hermes in RN)

### Code Examples
- Real examples from the framework codebase
- State management with hooks
- Component composition patterns
- Layout system demonstrations

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start production server
npm start
```

## Technology Stack
